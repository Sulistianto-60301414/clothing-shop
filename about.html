        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Founded in 2023, Clothify emerged from a simple belief: that quality clothing should be accessible, sustainable, and timeless. We started as a small team of designers and fashion enthusiasts who were frustrated with the fast fashion industry's impact on both people and the planet.</p>
        
        <p>Our mission is to create clothing that you'll love for years to come, made with care for both craftsmanship and environmental responsibility.</p>
